# manual Delaunay triangulation using the Bowyer-Watson algorithm

The current project, developed for the Spatial Databases course, provides a manual implementation ofthe Delaunay algorithm on a random set of points.

From a random set of points like this:

the manual Delaunay triangulation is the following:

which is consistent with the Delaunay triangulation applied by the scipy library:
